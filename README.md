This Project was created for the purpose of creating a backlog of employee's beverage drinking habbits.

The project was created by having basic features in mind like:
    Adding a Backlog, which consists of employee name and their beverage of choice for the day.
    Showcasing the entire backlog
    Categorizing beverages and finding the most popular beverage type, Coffee or Tea or Other.

To run this, clone the repository, install the dependenceies in /backend folder and in the main folder(Client side), 
Add a ".env" file to connect the application with your MongoDB and finally start the application (npm start).
